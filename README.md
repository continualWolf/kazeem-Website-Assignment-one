Term Two Assignment One, Build a simple website

------------ Assignment task \/ ------------

Kindly use both HTML and CSS to design and build a small website that provides an information 
portal for some aspect of your work/workplace. For example, something that would be suitable for a 
staff intranet. It should be something that you would find useful to have at work, but doesn’t currently 
exist, or doesn’t exist in the form that you would like it to be in. You might consider examples such 
as:
▪ A place to find information about work and social events or training.
▪ An information source regarding standard working procedures.
▪ A place providing advice about how to perform certain tasks.
▪ A site providing orientation advice for new staff.
▪ An informal buy and sell area and so on.
The website should consist of at least three pages and use only HTML and CSS to control content 
and appearance. The coding and design should conform to recognised web standards. Your 
attention to standards should be explicitly described in your report.
The website should contain elements such as: 
▪ A clear home page 
▪ Well-structured text 
▪ Internal and external links 
▪ Images 
▪ Some form contents
